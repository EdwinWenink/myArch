### GENERAL STRUCTURE

1) getmail --> retrieve email and store them in a mail folder. Default is ~/mail

2) neomutt (or mutt) reads out the specified mail folder.

3) notmuch can be used in combination with mutt to effectively index and search all mail. Configuration of notmuch is straightforward on a first run of notmuch.

4) Adjust the sendmail variable in the mutt configuration file to refer to msmtp for sending emails.

###
Basic examples of configuration files are included in this folder.

Make sure to set the right permissions for sending emails: chmod 600  ~/.msmtprc
To pass a password with the gnome-keyring for getmail, use:
getmail --store-password-in-gnome-keyring

To pass a password for msmtp with gnome keyring, use:

The .getmail and .msmtprc should be located in the home directory
The neomutt folder belongs in ~/.config/
